Quick examples

Basic test structure:

```toml
[config]
base_url = "https://api.example.com"

[[tests]]
name = "Get user"
method = "GET"
endpoint = "/users/1"
expected_status = 200
```

Use variables and assertions:

```toml
[[tests]]
name = "Verify Email"
method = "GET"
endpoint = "/users/{{user_id}}"
expected_status = 200

[tests.headers]
Authorization = "Bearer ${{API_TOKEN}}"

[[tests.assertions]]
type = "PathRegex"
value = ["$.email", "^[^@]+@example\\.com$"]
```
