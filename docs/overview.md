# Catalyst — API testing that scales from first test to CI

Catalyst is a lightweight, declarative HTTP API testing tool. Define tests in readable TOML, run them locally or in CI, and evolve them from simple checks to full workflows without writing glue code.

Why teams choose Catalyst
- Fast onboarding: copy‑pasteable Quickstart; first green test in minutes.
- Readable by default: test intent lives in TOML, easy to review and diff.
- Powerful when needed: variables, chaining, assertions, hooks, and file bodies.
- CI‑friendly: single binary, deterministic output, and exit codes.

What you can do
- Smoke test endpoints and status codes.
- Validate JSON responses with exact, contains, and regex assertions.
- Chain requests by extracting values (JSON paths, cookies, headers).
- Enforce latency budgets and surface performance regressions.
- Prepare/cleanup data via safe command hooks with allow‑listing.

Start here
- Getting Started: Quickstart → Your First Test → Running Tests.
